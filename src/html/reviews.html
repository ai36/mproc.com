                                No one wants cancer, and no one wants chemo or radiation, but sometimes you don't have a choice. My recurrent endometrial cancer had invaded my bladder and was causing some very serious problems for me. Enter this most wonderful group of angels-in-disguise who work (more like serve) at Radiation Oncology Care at Meridian Park. From the receptionist to the medical assistant to the technicians to Dr. Chong (and that other very important person in the back office who helps devise the treatment plan), you could not ask for more compassionate and qualified people to help you in probably what will be one of the most challenging times in your life. I loved the ease of traveling to the facility (worth any drive in my opinion), the generous parking, the weekly physical exams, the encouragement that was offered at every step of the way, the open and honest two-way communication, and the relationship of trust that is so necessary while undergoing radiation. I would go there again in a heartbeat but hopefully that won't be necessary as my cancer on follow-up PET scan was gone (large vaginal mass with invasion into the bladder, lymph node involvement, and possible omental involvement). I could not be more pleased with the outcome these people saved my life. You will be in good hands - I promise!
